<h1>Tofrodos - Converts text files between MSDOS and Unix file formats</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>
<span class="programname">fromdos</span> [options] [<span class="filename">file...</span>]<br />
<span class="programname">todos</span> [options] [<span class="filename">file...</span>]<br />
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
DOS text files traditionally have carriage return and line feed pairs
as their newline characters while Unix text files have the line feed
as their newline character. <span class="programname">fromdos</span>
converts text files from the DOS format to the Unix format, while
<span class="programname">todos</span>
converts text files from the Unix format to the DOS format.
</p>

<p>
The programs accept multiple filenames and wildcards as their arguments.
You may also use them in a pipe.
If either program finds its input redirected, it will process stdin
and place the output on stdout.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<dl>
<dt>-a</dt>
<dd>
Always convert. If converting from DOS to Unix, this option will
cause the program to remove ALL carriage returns. The default is to
remove carriage returns only if they are followed by line feeds.
If converting from
Unix to DOS, this option will cause the program to convert ALL
linefeeds to carriage return pairs. The default is to convert linefeeds
only if they are not already preceeded by a carriage return.
</dd>
<dt>-b</dt>
<dd>
Make a backup of original file. The original
file is renamed with the original filename and a <span class="filename">.bak</span>
extension.
</dd>
<dt>-d</dt>
<dd>
Convert from DOS to Unix. This forces the program to convert the file in
a particular direction. By default, if the program is named
<span class="programname">fromdos</span> or <span class="programname">dos2unix</span>
it will assume that the input file is in a DOS format and convert it to
a Unix format. If the program is named <span class="programname">todos</span> or
<span class="programname">unix2dos</span> it will assume that the input file is in a Unix format and convert it to
a DOS format. Using the <span class="optionchar">-d</span> option forces the program to convert from a DOS
format to a Unix format regardless of how the program is named. Likewise, using the
<span class="optionchar">-u</span> option forces the program to convert from a Unix format to a DOS format
regardless of the name of the program.
</dd>
<dt>-e</dt>
<dd>
Abort processing on any error in any file. Normally, the program will
simply skip to process the next file on the command line when it encounters
any errors. This option causes it to abort on errors.
</dd>
<dt>-f</dt>
<dd>
Force: convert even if the file is not writeable (read-only). By default,
if <span class="programname">fromdos</span> or <span class="programname">todos</span>
finds that the file does not have write permission, it will not process
that file. This option forces the conversion even if the file is read-only.
</dd>
<dt>-h</dt>
<dd>
Display a short help screen on the program usage and quit.
</dd>
<dt>-l &lt;logfile&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Log error messages to &lt;logfile&gt;. Note that if your command line has an
error, such as when you specify an unknown option, the error message for the
command line option error will be issued to stderr instead and not logged.
</dd>
<dt>-o</dt>
<dd>
Overwrite the original file (no backup). This is the default.
</dd>
<dt>-p</dt>
<dd>
Preserve file ownership and time. On systems like Linux, the file
ownership will only be preserved if the user is root, otherwise it
will just set the file time and silently fail the change of file
ownership. If you want a warning message when the file ownership
cannot be changed, use -v.
</dd>
<dt>-u</dt>
<dd>
Convert from Unix to DOS. See the <span class="optionchar">-d</span> option above for more information.
</dd>
<dt>-v</dt>
<dd>
Verbose.
</dd>
<dt>-V</dt>
<dd>
Show version message and quit.
</dd>
</dl>
