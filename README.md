# BASTOOL
A swiss army knife for reworking old school basic 
You got a bunch of tools on hand toe despagettyfie old basic code from the 8 bit area.
The tool can help you to get this old code compiled for Example FREEBASIC, BASIC64 and others.
By its ability to separate Strings precidely you also can add localisation to such a old programm.
It can generate cross reference, remove linenumber and convert them to labels and other nice and handy things.
A lot of ugly old basic constructs will be fixed automatically.
A nice manual is also included. Sorry for my bad english ;)
So enjoy your old games after a slight afford of time and let us blast some alien slime ;)
